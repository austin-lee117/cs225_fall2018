After half a year of travel, you reach Mars. As the leader of both the SpaceX and Tesla teams, you work hard on figuring out a way back home as well as creating the foundations of a Mars colony. It takes several months of hard work but you create a small sustainable ecosystem and functioning power supply just as the food rations deplete. Within the year, the team is ready to head back to Earth. You can choose to stay and continue to work on the colony, or return back to be crowned a hero.
