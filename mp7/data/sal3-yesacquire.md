You are now a multimillionaire, having sold your company Zip2. You decide to invest and co-found a new company one month later called X.com. It merges with Confinity and the two companies work together under the new name of PayPal. In October 2002, you are once again given a decision. Ebay has offered $1.5B in stock. Do you accept? Yes or No.

You receive $165M as part of the deal. You are even more rich, a few years older, but still full of ideas with a bright future ahead of you.

You decline their offer. PayPal remains largely successful, but you are unable to climb upwards. After many decades of working under the bureaucratic system, you finally give up.
