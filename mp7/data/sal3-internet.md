Four years past and your company Zip2 has become huge. One day in February 1999, Compaq offers $307M and $34M in stock options to acquire your company. Do you accept their offer? Yes or no.

You refuse their offer. Shortly thereafter, your company is beaten by competitors and you forlornly watch the industry move forward without you.
